# droidcam-reinstall
Reinstall Droidcam on Linux when updates break it

I use Droidcam to make a webcam out of my old Android phone. I use Fedora. It seems every so often, a kernel update will break Droidcam, and it needs to be reinstalled.

This script will uninstall Droidcam and reinstall it, so that the kernel headers match. There may be another way to deal with this, but this is a quick fix.

To use, simply run the reinstall.sh script.
